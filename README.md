Once the server is running, you can access the application at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.
Payment Integration
For late submission fees, the system utilizes a payment gateway. Ensure you have a payment gateway set up and configured in the backend. Update the payment URL in the frontend accordingly.

Technologies Used
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing library data.
Express.js: Node.js framework for building the backend.
